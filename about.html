<h2 id="why-boring-tech">Why Boring Tech</h2>

<p>First up, this is in no way a deference to the other ‘Boring Company’ started by the real world Iron Man.<br />
<a href="https://youtu.be/U0sJJU3FaOQ">Elon is  way cooler </a> than any of us will ever be and we know we can’t compete with that!</p>

<p>There wasn’t any deep, profound, serendepitous moment that led to the birth of The Boring Tech Company.<br />
Unfortunately, as the name implies, there was none of that.</p>

<p>It was born after years of toil at multiple startups and <em>observing</em> how they moved from pillar to post chasing ‘growth’ and achieving their everchanging goals.<br />
These were the ‘cool’, over-achievers that everyone wants to be and imitate.</p>

<p>This led the founder to yearn for something more boring. Can there be a company that</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pays special attention to it’s customers’ needs and tries extremely hard to delight them</li>
  <li>Aims to provide a sense of purpose and achievement to our employees</li>
  <li>Makes few things - but remarkably well</li>
</ul>

<p>This led to the birth of The Boring Tech Company.</p>

<h2 id="but-whats-with-the-boring">But What’s with the Boring?</h2>
<p>The greatest threat to Success is not failure - it’s boredom.
Be it an <a href="https://youtu.be/_6-6QAMidv4">athlete</a> who choses to put in training hours every day, or a band of <a href="https://medium.com/@theImranLshow/what-do-the-beatles-and-bill-gates-have-in-common-58ecb81130a5"> ‘Genius’ musicians </a> who end up being an ‘Overnight’ success or a <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/"> master craftsman </a> who created one of the most succesful companies on the planet by insisting the insides of a computer look good.<br />
Every ‘Sustained Success’ conceals [potentially thousands of] hours of dedicated, diligent hard work that has gone into it. Consistent hard work is boring.</p>

<p>In this age of ‘build fast and break things’; of shipping faulty ‘MVPs’ - all in the name of ‘urgency’; of fastest possible gratification; lets embrace the joy of craftsmanship. Honing your craft is boring.</p>

<p>There is an undeniable urgency in our times - more so for a rag-tag band of professionals trying to build a company.<br />
It is easy for individuals and entire companies to get lured into the pull of the shiny, to choose quantity over quality and to sacrifice peace for speed.</p>

<p>The only way, thus, to differentiate our craft from the others is to choose both Quality and Speed.<br />
That is possible only through focussed hard work and a rigorous, ruthless process of eliminating the needless (which is mostly shiny), meticuluously listening to our customers in choosing what to build and staying honest to ourselves. This process is boring.</p>

<h2 id="company">Company</h2>
<p>The stress on employees is critical. Every company (hopefully) wants Happy Customers.<br />
Here, at BoringTech, we firmly believe that unhappy employees cannot get you happy customers (atleast not for a sustained period of time).<br />
So if we want Happy Customers (we truly do) we gotta start with Happy People.</p>

<p>There is also another reason to keep employees at the center of a company.\ 
For thousands of years, our identity and our value system has been shaped significantly based on the region (governed by a kingdom or a government) that we have been fortunate or unfortunate enough to be born in.<br />
In modern times, however, a person’s value system evolves - not as a function of their geographic origins - but as a function of what they chose to identify with. This may be in the form of the books they read, or the subreddits they’re a part of, or the twitterati they choose to follow.
The knowledge economy, has enabled thousands of knowledge workers to, through their hard work ofcourse, search and get to the kind of work they <em>value</em> the most and be a part of a region that resonates well with their chosen <em>value system</em>.<br />
Since a knowledge worker spends atleast 40 hours a week at work (usually more), where they choose to work will increasingly be a function of their value system <strong><em>and vice versa</em></strong>.</p>

<p>A ‘Company’, thus, represents more than just a place to work and make money. Apart from the usual vision and purpose, an organisation also represents a set of choices - a value system(with ideals and aspirations), a community(with a moral and social fabric) and a culture rooted in meritocracy, hard work and scientific method.</p>
