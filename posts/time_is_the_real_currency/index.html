This was the singularly brilliant summation of a long discussion the company’s founder and I had. It was one of those long walks we occasionally took in the middle of the afternoon - when the weather was still pleasant and there was a lot to talk about. The topic of discussion was Developer Productivity.<br /> We were <sup id="fnref:fn0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn0" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> the fastest <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/udaan-on-a-high-may-be-the-fastest-to-join-unicorn-club/articleshow/65650826.cms"> growing company in India </a> and had hit a Billion Dollars in valuation with a team of about 20 engineers.<br /> Developer productivity wasn’t just an aspirational goal for us. We <em>needed</em> to be highly productive to even <em>survive</em> the challenges we faced on a daily basis and what lied ahead of us.<br /> I’ve always heard Time == Money, but that never really struck me as vividly as the above statement. I feel it is profound and cuts through all clutter in our head.</p><p>Now that I have some more time to reflect on it, I wanted to try and best summarise what I’ve learnt on my journey so far. This is a result of ~8 years of introspection &amp; observations while working in some of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yogeshnachnani/"> fastest growing companies on the planet </a>.

This is the only universal law of software development (if there ever was one).<br /> There is no ‘absolute right’.

Alas)<br /> When I reflect on it, it seems quite odd.</p><p>Think about it - programming these days should be <em>easier</em>.

Change it’s parameters? Add Default values to parameters? All this can be accomplished <em>via a single shortcut</em>.<br /> Want to Toggle Breakpoints? Jump in and out of methods while debugging? Yup, can be done in a single stroke.</p><p>How to do it?<br /> Every time you are presented with a task that requires you to do any of the following, spend 5 minutes to check if your IDE has a command for it</p><ul><li>Repeat a change multiple times (like renaming a method everywhere it is being used)<li>Switch tabs or windows to get from one place in code to the other (like going back to the method that you edited 10 minutes back)<li>Interact with an external tool (say, running your build by switching to the terminal)<li>Whenever you are using the mouse - your IDE will have a keyboard shortcut for it</ul><p>Also, spend 10 minutes a day going through any available tutorial for your IDE.

While most of your coding would happen on an IDE, you’d invariably end up using a terminal based text editor for some part of your work.<br /> It may be while checking log files, or while writing a blog post (like this one) or logging on to a server and direct-editing files there<sup id="fnref:fnd" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fnd" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.<br /> I <em>cannot</em> imagine writing this blog on any other tool apart from my trusted vim.

Going by the above calculation, <strong>if one person on a team of 10 engineers spends 3 whole days shaving off even 30 seconds on a task done by everyone only 5 times a day, we would have gotten a complete return on investment over a period of just 6 months</strong>. Bring that up in your next sprint planning meet.<br /> People always talk about the prodigious 5X engineer. The reality, though, is a lot more boring than that. 5X engineers, in my opinion, are those that help 5 more developers save some time in daily tasks.</p><p>Just like other things, chances are that whatever you’re looking to do, there’s a tool for that. In case you’re having trouble finding one, <a href="mailto:yogesh@theboringtech.io">email me</a> and we can find one together.</p><h4 class="no_toc" id="tests">Tests</h4><p>Tests are, unfortunately, one of those contentious ‘Engineering’ topics that I mentioned earlier.<br /> Each time you’ve written a piece of code, or reviewed a piece of code, or have spent time diagnosing a bug - if you have a test case for that method/class/API, you’ll be able to move faster (and this applies to all members for your team, mind you)<br /> I am personally whole heartedly subscribed to having tests at all possible levels one can, but that’s the thing - you <em>don’t need to be</em>. The quest here is to <em>save time</em>, and like with all ‘Engineering Stuff’, there are tradeoffs and there are more than one ways to achieve the same goal.</p><h4 class="no_toc" id="continuous-delivery">Continuous Delivery</h4><p><a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/"> Continuous Delivery </a> processes help you significantly save time avoiding routine dances before a release.<br /> A word of caution, though - simply <em>deploying to production</em> multiple times a day <strong>does not qualify</strong> as continuous delivery.<br /> There is more than enough information on the principles and practices of CD on the website (and Jez &amp; Fowler’s books/lectures) that I need not go deeper into it.</p><p>Just remember - the Returns of even 1 engineer’s efforts on setting up good CD practices are multiplicative.</p><h4 class="no_toc" id="script-it-out">Script it out</h4><p>The power of scripting for low-fi tasks is invaluable.</p><ul><li>Do you routinely check for the same ‘x’ things while diagnosing an issue?

Of course, it was always an emergency since the application was acting up and users were affected; and Of course, <em>it must be the infra</em> which is responsible for it.<br /> It’s easy to suggest,<strong>“It <em>must</em> be the kernel [or the network or the database or the infrastructure]”</strong>. Don’t be that person. Don’t <em>guess</em> things - learn to diagnose things on your own.</p><p>Yes, we deal with complex systems when we deploy our code today. The application code we deploy may end up running in a container which itself is running on a Host Operating System running other containers; the Host OS may itself run as a Virtual Machine which may run on another completely different Operating System sitting in a big box which hosts 10s of such machines. Our code may ‘hit an API’ which results in multiple network hops - perhaps to a machine located in an adjacent building in the same ‘Data Center’.<br /> <strong><em>Every parameter</em></strong> of <strong><em>everything involved in that setup</em></strong> - from the configuration of the OS, to the number of applications running on the host system, to a link flapping on a network cable on the core switch can result in your application behaving weird. This is the reality. While it is <em>almost impossible</em> to know <em>everything</em> about your infrastructure, simple tools will help you navigate a large subset of routinely faced issues.</p><h4 class="no_toc" id="learn-how-things-are-deployed-to-production">Learn how things are deployed to production</h4><p>Figure how/where your application code runs.<br /> Is it running in a container? What is the configuration of the host machine? Do you know where to look to get basic stats on CPU and IO usage (Network &amp; Disk)?<br /> Does traffic come to it via a load balancer? Where do you find the stats for that?<br /> How is a service call to a dependency (datastore or other application) made? Does it involve a network?

YD(Young dev): It will help us scale faster in the future and guard 
against the impedance mismatch between the core business logic and the 
rate at which clients hit the API.

Me: Sure, but do you really want to take on the complexity of having a distributed queue so soon in the life cycle of your application? It'll probably not hit the scale you mentioned for quite some time

YD: Oh there's no complexity, we can just use the one provided by 
&lt;cloud-provider-x&gt;

Me: But what if it looses data? Since your application deals with 
money, it is critical we don't loose a single piece of information

YD: How will a queue loose data?

Me: Any distributed system can loose data

YD: How so?

Me: Ever had a payment fail where your money was deducted but the 
order failed at the merchant page? That's a distributed system losing 
data (Not the best of examples, I know)

YD: That's different. Those are multiple different services and 
ecosystems. Queues reside within the same private cloud - probably the 
same data center. The problems of the internet don't apply here 
(Oh Snap! He got me)

Me: Yes, but there is still a network. And the queue given by 
&lt;cloud-provider-x&gt; is yet another piece of software written by people 
like you and me. What if it has a bug ?

YD: Oh

Similarly, there is no ‘absolute wrong’.</p><p>One of my favourite software stories is unfortunately not a first hand experience. This was from early 2010s when a friend worked for a company that deployed engineers in the client’s team to augment their bandwidth. They were supporting a complicated piece of legacy software. My friend found a piece of code ‘written in an odd way’. He couldn’t intuitively grasp it and thought it could be ‘written better’<sup id="fnref:fn5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>. He did what most of us do - googled around and <em>found</em> a better way.<br /> He then cautiously approached the grey-bearded engineer who had originally written that code. My friend pointed to the ‘design pattern’ on the internet and suggested how code could be written better.<br /> To his absolute credit, my friend inquired sincerely as to why the code was written the way it was.<br /> To this, the older engineer promptly replied “Why yes, of course this does seem better. But you know the thing is, <strong><em>when I wrote this, there was no internet</em></strong>”</p><p>I absolutely love this story and remind myself each time I look to <em>blame someone for how it’s written</em>.<br /> If you write code for long enough, you will come across code that would want you to become the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/9csrpv/always_code_as_if_the_guy_who_ends_up_reading/">proverbial psychopath</a> and shoot the original author.<br /> However, it is important to be empathetic instead.
