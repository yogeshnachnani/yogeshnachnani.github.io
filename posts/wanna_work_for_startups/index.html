This usually holds true only for higher levels &amp; designations. Also, the potential size of the IPO will make a huge difference to your expected pay out (Will it be 1B? 5B? 100B?). This can be a much easier decision as the “return” you’re expecting is money - and it should be easy to weigh the risk vs reward when it comes to other options on the table (including your current gig).</p><p>Keep in mind that Series D+ startups have the problems of smaller companies as well as BigTech. So really, don’t join a Series D startup just because you’re looking for “startup experience”.</p><h2 id="not-so-important-question---can-i-make-it"><span class="me-2">Not so important question - “Can I make it”?</span><a href="#not-so-important-question---can-i-make-it" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Invariably, this is the reason I’ve heard that keeps most people from jumping into startups. There’s this fear that after a while you’ll find it too hard or that you’ll lose out on work/life balance. Both of these may be true; but both may be false too. You’ll never know till you try.</p><p>I’ve managed to follow a mostly 8am-4:30pm schedule at a fast paced startup (went from 40M to 3B in 2 years). There are also others I know who work exclusively for startups and have thriving personal lives &amp; hobbies. Besides, we live in an AI-first world where developer productivity can be super-charged if you have a solid AI toolkit.</p><p>Really, it’s all upto how you manage to hold on - and always keep the more important questions in mind: <strong>What are you gaining in exchange for the things you’re giving up</strong> Join a startup; keep asking this question every 6-12 months; and quit if it looks like you’re getting the short straw.<br /><br /> Hopefully, you’ll have a rewarding career spanning decades. Embrace the adventure for 1-2 years. My guess is that it’ll be worth it.</p><h2 id="final-words"><span class="me-2">Final Words</span><a href="#final-words" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Startups, usually, are all about being contrarian and right. So choose to ignore this framework and build your own framework to find success. If anything, I’d be the happiest if I could seed the <em>thought</em> of thinking in frameworks when making career choices.</p><p>PS: Liked reading? Hated it? Any thoughts/questions/comments?
