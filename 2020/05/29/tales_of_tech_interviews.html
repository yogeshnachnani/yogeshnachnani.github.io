</ul>
<hr />
<p>I like to believe that I’m a decent developer. There’s no <em>real</em> proof of that, apart from the bits n pieces occasional compliments from coworkers; and the
absence of outright remarks of evident stupidity over the last ~8 years.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved programming, and - at the same time - I’ve always  <em>sucked</em> at competitive programming.<br />
Basically, if there was a gun to my head and the only way I could get out of it was by solving a programming puzzle, I’d start making calls to the people I love.</p>

<p>That should serve as a decent precursor for the tales to come, and how I generally fare in tech interviews.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-interview">My First Interview</h2>
<p>This was for a BigTech company in college. I was the crowd favourite to get through<sup id="fnref:fnc"><a href="#fn:fnc" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The interview started. I was completely bamboozled by the question. I knew I basically had to narrow down to a data structure, but for the life of me I couldn’t settle on one!<br />
Needless to say, the 2nd question never came.<br />
After the interview, a friend was kind enough to point out that it was a ‘simple tournament tree’ problem. <em>Tournament what now?</em><br />
To me, in the interview room, it was equivalent to being asked to figure out the equation for the quantum wave function in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Over the next 15 days, before my next interview, I inhaled the contents of <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/"> Cracking The Coding Interview </a>.<br />
I guess it was only because of CTCI that I feel I interviewed <em>reasonably well</em>. That, and the fact that my interviewers asked some offbeat questions and
valued first principles.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="interviews-with-bigtechs">Interviews with BigTechs</h2>
<p>Over the course of my work life, I’ve interviewed with other BigTech companies only twice - and with predictable results.<br />
Here’s how one phone screen went:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Interviewer: Hey, I'm &lt;name-I-can't-recollect&gt;
Me: Hey there, how's it going?
Interviewer: Going good. Here's your question
Given a number 'n', Print brackets in a certain way
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It took me about 30seconds to realise that I’m not gonna get this one.<br />
Don’t get me wrong, I am not a pessimist or a <em>giver upper</em> - I just know what I don’t know.<br />
Still, I tried to solve the puzzle - <em>thinking out loud</em> all the time<sup id="fnref:fna"><a href="#fn:fna" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, which was met by radio silence from the other end.<br />
About 10 minutes in, the interviewer also realised that this wasn’t going anywhere - but we were both <em>duty &amp; honor bound</em> to see it through for the next 30 minutes.<br />
Such a waste of valuable human time. I almost wanted to apologise.<br />
Days later it was pointed out to me that this was a ‘simple DP problem’.</p>

<p>A similar episode came up with another BigTech. I was asked a variation of Binary Search<br />
The expectation, of course, was to <em>get the solution quickly</em> and then <em>code it out (on paper)</em><sup id="fnref:fnpa"><a href="#fn:fnpa" class="footnote">3</a></sup> while covering all the tricky edge cases.<br />
If you’re following the trend here, that - <em>of course</em> - didn’t happen. I took like 5 minutes<sup id="fnref:fnh"><a href="#fn:fnh" class="footnote">4</a></sup> to get those bounds right; but of course, the interviewer gleefully pointed out all those edge cases one by one. I think this time I did end up apologising.</p>

<p>This is not meant to evoke any sympathy towards my inability to interview well. I’ve been blessed to have a rewarding career so far and worked with some of the best people around - all outside of BigTechs.<br />
This is also not about the grapes being sour - it is not a critique about the process that BigTech companies follow</p>

<p>However, it’s notable to point out that <em>I don’t remember even the names of my interviewers</em>, let alone remembering what they did or about their teams.<br />
I did not have a very engaging conversation with them as they got right to the question.</p>

<p>These are the learnings that I try to incorporate as an interviewer. Most people forget that an interview is a conversation first.<br />
At the very least, we can try to make it a good, engaging conversation. I always start my interviews trying to have a decent conversation with interviewees rather than ‘getting down to business’.<br />
A good side effect of this is that it generally helps the candidate relax.<br />
Sure, they may not meet your standards in the end, but it is still worth spending some time engaging them.<br />
At the very least, they’ll have a decent time and you would have done well as an ambassador for your company.<br />
At best, they would remember that and write about you in a blog a few years down the line<sup id="fnref:fnt"><a href="#fn:fnt" class="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="product-centric-interviews">Product Centric Interviews</h2>
<p>My interview with booking.com was my first experience of a process which was tailor made to reflect company culture and priorities.<br />
The first phone screen was taken by a software developer and an employee from the customer experience team. It was a refreshing revelation!<sup id="fnref:fnr"><a href="#fn:fnr" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. The pre-question and post-question conversation was especially enriching since I got to know more about the company and not just the tech team.</p>

<p>Similarly, in one of their on-site rounds, I was asked a question that circled around a hotel owner’s working capital. This had nothing to do with data structures or algorithms and was the first time I actually thought of a real customer problem during an interview.<br />
I don’t think I did well there and I didn’t get the offer. But I still remember <em>most</em> of the conversation <em>and</em> the name of my interviewer.<sup id="fnref:fnf"><a href="#fn:fnf" class="footnote">7</a></sup><br />
The biggest takeaway from booking.com interview, as was pointed out by my interviewer, was “Basically we are here to solve a business problem. It’s important to us to evaluate how people approach such problems”. They didn’t pretend to be a hardcore tech company and were sincere and straightforward about what they were looking for. Despite not getting the offer, I loved the experience.</p>

<p>One of the companies I later ended up working for had a similar interview process and I whole heartedly subscribed to it.<br />
If we are not inventing new algorithms <em>day to day</em> or even <em>once in a while</em> then it’s important not to focus on those aspects of programming, and instead focus on what we <em>will end up doing day to day</em> - which is solving a problem related to the company’s business.<br />
Luckily, I see a lot of companies coming around to this idea.<br />
There may be a lot of you reading this who may not align with this - which is fine. But I do suggest at least trying out with a company with a different hiring process - you may be enriched by the experience alone.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="best-interview-ever">Best Interview Ever<sup id="fnref:fnhy"><a href="#fn:fnhy" class="footnote">8</a></sup></h2>
<p>My best interview experience, in fact, wasn’t even an interview at all. It was the initial email exchange I had while interviewing for DataStax.<br />
DataStax is all remote, and I loved how their recruiting process was tailor-made for their needs.<br />
The first email had a set of 3 questions</p>
<ul>
  <li>What do you know about data structure X and Y. When would you prefer X and when would you use Y</li>
  <li>Develop an algorithm to solve a problem (which was evidently applicable to a distributed database)</li>
  <li>Think about various optimisations to the above solution under different constraints</li>
</ul>

<p>I was blown away by the simplicity yet effectiveness of this first screening round.<br />
It checked my technical skills, the stuff I kept in mind while thinking of real world implementation &amp;&amp; the way I presented my thoughts.<br />
Even though I was really impressed by the screening <em>email</em> itself, I was further blown away by the next task.<br />
I was asked to download Cassandra and implement a certain feature in it. If I needed help, I was pointed to the IRC and mailing list. That’s it!<sup id="fnref:fnit"><a href="#fn:fnit" class="footnote">9</a></sup><br />
What an incredible way to screen for <em>exactly</em> what you value - right from the get go (and before any 1-on-1 interviews).<br />
We had to cut the process short since I had an offer from another company - I didn’t want to waste my interviewer’s time, even though I would have loved to go ahead with the process.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting Thoughts</h2>
<p>To me, Hiring is one of the most important processes for an organisation, yet it is often overlooked.<br />
It basically determines who comes in and sits next to you to share the day to day burden of your challenging work.<br />
It is specifically crucial for startups to ensure that the process tests for the skills that are relevant for day-to-day jobs, rather than aping established processes by bigger companies.</p>

<p>Another part that generally gets missed out is iteration &amp; reflection. Once a hiring process is set, it almost never gets changed.<br />
A/B deployments and iteration techniques are a <em>given</em> when it comes to building a product these days, I wonder why it is not applied to internal processes too.</p>

<p>Also, a quick word for younger devs out there:</p>

<p>Try not to make it your life’s mission to get to a <em>specific company</em>.<br />
There is little to no correlation between how great a career you’ll build with the company you work at.<br />
Being in a BigTech won’t guarantee you’re surrounded by geniuses; and being at a startup doesn’t guarantee that you’ll morph into a rockstar or an urban legend.<br />
If you’re really looking to build a solid and fulfilling career, try to focus on yourself and improving your skills.</p>

<p>Lastly, don’t get disheartened if a few interviews go bad. Unfortunately, no matter how much we try, interviews <em>cannot be 100% objective</em>. So a few of them going bad don’t mean much.<br />
If a lot of them are going bad, that’s ok too - look for a company with an interview process that is different (<em>not easier</em>) than the ones you’re trying out for. You may just chance upon a great fit!</p>
