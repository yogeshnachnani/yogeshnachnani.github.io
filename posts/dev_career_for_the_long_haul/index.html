class="content"><p>I’d like to believe I’m not old enough to hand out career advice with authority.<sup id="fnref:fnh"><a href="#fn:fnh" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><br /> Although, occassionaly, I am on the receiving end of innocently hurtful comments from fresh grads who say, <strong>“Oh, I didn’t realise you’re <em>more</em> than 10 years older than me”</strong><sup id="fnref:fns"><a href="#fn:fns" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p><p>I consider myself fortunate to have been around some amazing mentors.<br /> At the very least, I hope this turns out to be a distillation of advice I’ve received over the years from people smarter than I am.</p><p>It’s a longish read, but if you are in a hurry here’s the most important advice:<br /> Hunt for a great mentor and just latch on to them. If you can’t find one, then hunt for one outside of your current workplace/environment.<br /> The surest way to upskill yourself is to be <a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/maria-konnikova/">taught by someone who is very good at what they do.</a></p><hr /><h2 id="choice-of-place-of-work"><span class="me-2">[Choice of] Place of Work</span><a href="#choice-of-place-of-work" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>A wise person once said, “A good place to work is one where the feeling of loserishness is prevelant”.<br /> Simply put, you’re at the right place if you feel like a loser next to the folks <em>around you</em>.</p><p>The <em>around you</em> part is important. Admiring accomplished coworkers from far off won’t help you level up.<br /> If possible, try to be part of a team with someone you look up to.<br /> A large part of your learning will come from your immediate peers. Surround yourself with folks who are more accomplished, more hungry and more driven than you are - <em>you’ll feel like a loser in front of them</em>, but you’ll learn the most too.</p><p>I know, working closely with someone you look up to can be intimidating.<br /> But apart from ridiculously fast paced learning, there is a great side effect to it too. When you carefuly observe people, you realise that everyone <em>is human</em> and has their own shortcomings.<br /> This makes it less intimidating over time and encourages you to build a thought process that is inspired by, but hopefully free from, your mentor’s biases.</p><hr /><h2 id="stick-to-projects"><span class="me-2">Stick to Projects</span><a href="#stick-to-projects" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Substantive learning comes from feedback. As a developer, you’ll get feedback from all quarters - peers, managers, team leads &amp; perhaps even customers.</p><p>Your code gives you feedback too. The code you write &amp; the product it brings to life are constantly evolving.<br /> That abstraction you crafted will become too brittle in a few months.<br /> That API you so agonized over will no longer be used.<br /> If you’re lucky - you’ll get to see your code undero major refactoring or even a rewrite!</p><p><strong>It is imperative</strong> that you stick around to witness this. Only through multiple iterations does one develop an intuition about what really matters when you code.</p><p>In my last company, we had taken the decision of not using any ORM.<sup id="fnref:fng"><a href="#fn:fng" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><br /> When a new recruit asked why, I simply said that it’s because all ORMs suck.<br /> He was semi-offended at that. He mentioned he’d used &lt;foo-ORM&gt; in a dozen or so services in the past without encountering any issues.</p><p>I tried to explain how as the code ages &amp; the data model gets complex, you end up having to manage the ORM more than manage your own code.<br /> Since we’re a startup, our data models would see constant flux for the foreseeable future. Hence, it was much easier to pick vanila SQL than to wrangle with an ORM</p><p>What I said didn’t appeal to him very much and was evidently not convinced with our collective reasoning.<br /> I gave him various scenarios where simple things like multi table queries, frequent migrations with backward compatibility etc with &lt;foo-ORM&gt; would become a hassle.<br /> Some of these seemed to bring him round a bit, but he mentioned he still liked the <em>convenience</em> &lt;foo-ORM&gt; offered.<br /> On further introspection, we realised that the <em>convenience</em> is merely that of a few saved SQL queries.</p><p>During our conversation, I also found out that in his previous company, he had not been able to stick around a project for more than a quarter or two.<br /> Thus, while he had used &lt;foo-ORM&gt; during the initial setup, he had never been in a position to have felt the pain I spoke of.<br /> If he had had the opportunity to stick around long enough, he would have learnt a bit about the trade-offs that come with it.</p><p>Iteration brings this wisdom. When you’re face to face with your past choices, you innately learn about how valuable they really were.</p><p>Of course, there is no one universal truth - your <em>experiences</em> will shape how you think as an engineer.<br /> Perhaps requirements will change too often and you’ll end up hating PMs.<br /> Perhaps you’ll hit scale sooner than expected and start taking observability &amp; infrastructure choices more seriously.</p><p>But at <strong><em>at a bare minimum</em></strong>, you’ll learn about at least one thing that matters in the long run and about a dozen other things that really don’t.</p><hr /><h2 id="take-up-a-shitty-maintenance-project"><span class="me-2">Take up a Shitty Maintenance Project</span><a href="#take-up-a-shitty-maintenance-project" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Now, I know you think I’ve gone completely bonkers!<br /> But, trust me, that is not career suicide!</p><p>The very first project that I took up as a ‘Lead Engineer’ was a bug infested, Oh-Lord-How-Does-This-Even-Work, Step-Child-Of-7-People nightmare of a project.<br /> To make my nights more fun and interesting, it was suddenly designated as a core platform project. The multi billion dollar company I worked for wanted to rely on it to provide critical alert functionality for their biggest upcoming October Sale.\</p><p>There’s a saying, “Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining it is a violent psychopath”. Obviously, people who wrote this junk hadn’t heard it.<br /> <em>I was the psychopath</em>, but I couldn’t turn violent because I didn’t have time for that! Since violence wasn’t an option, my subconscious mind chose to reconcile itself through literal nightmares instead.</p><p>Despite the pressure, I can safely say that I learnt a ton from other people’s mistakes (and without the blame/guilt that comes with making them!)<br /> Moreover, it helped me with some valuable skills</p><ul><li><strong>The ability to read code and make sense of it</strong>!<li>The confidence of being able to take up any code base (as shitty as can be) and be able to mould it as my own<sup id="fnref:fnb"><a href="#fn:fnb" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</ul><p>Both are something I pride myself on, and have come in extremely handy over the years.</p><hr /><h2 id="be-patient"><span class="me-2">Be Patient</span><a href="#be-patient" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>During one particular evaluation cycle, I really thought I deserved a promotion but I didn’t end up getting one.<br /> Coincidentally, I was also changing teams at the same time. So my performance discussion happened with my to-be manager in the same room along with my ex manager.<br /> I explained how I had clearly outperformed compared to what was expected, deserved the promotion and was being treated unfairly. I was outright rude.</p><p>Rather than being alarmed by such hostile behaviour, my new boss uttered the single most profound advice I’ve received - <strong>“So?”</strong><br /> The fuck did he mean by that?<sup id="fnref:fnn"><a href="#fn:fnn" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><br /> “Did you get to work on interesting stuff this past year?”. Yes<br /> “Do you think you gave it your best and are a better engineer today than you were a year before?”. Yes<br /> “Do you care about the little bit extra money you’d get if you were promoted?”. No<br /> “<strong>So how does it matter?</strong> Just suck it up and do what you’ve been doing”. Profound.</p><p>And of course it didn’t matter! What matters more is that it’s been 5 years to the day and he’s still someone I go to whenever I need some honest, no bulshit advice.<sup id="fnref:fnm"><a href="#fn:fnm" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p><p>I know - perhaps you’re skeptical. Thinking it doesn’t apply to you since you’re in a competitive, politicaly charged environment and these things <em>matter</em>.<br /> No they don’t. Trust me, I’ve been there. The above advice snapped me out of it and made me realise that how much you improve each day/week/month/year at the craft you care about &amp; the relationships you build over time are what matters.</p><p>One missed promotion, one missed opportunity doesn’t matter. If you’re hungry - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvB3Ec1dvTg">you’d get round to the next one</a>.</p><hr /><h3 id="footnotes"><span class="me-2">Footnotes</span><a href="#footnotes" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><ol><li id="fn:fnh"><p>People are always remarking how young I look.
